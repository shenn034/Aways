Public transport disruption in Victoria has become a common phenomenon, especially due to some big ongoing projects, such as, the Metro Tunnel Project, Level Crossing Removal Project, and the in-efficient public transport services during peak hours. Commuters to the CBD often confront inconveniences for disruptions caused by these on-going projects and in-efficient public transport services, resulting in delays at reaching work and an agitated start to the day. There is a reasonable scope of dealing with these disruptions in a smarter way, through the advancement of technology, especially for the car owners and make their journey to the CBD easier and more convenient.  

The intention is, to provide guidance during the transport disruptions, an android app, that guides its users to work/ appointments at the CBD during the disruptions. The services of the app involve: (i) Notifying its usersâ€™ with live disruption notifications (ii) Provide users with the best routes and means of travel (whether by bus, car or train) to help them get to work/appointments (iii) Special feature for the car users, in the form of navigation to the best possible parking spots in the CBD based on custom preference (iv) Rerouting service to an alternative parking spot if the initially suggested parking spot is exhausted.

For our data sources, we are focusing mainly on (i) The PTV Live API (ii) Google API (iii) The 5000 sensored parking spots in the CBD.

Our idea is not just limited to providing a solution covering the overall aspects of the transport disruptions, but to create an efficient and comforting travel experience for the commuters to the CBD, naming our app as "Aways".
